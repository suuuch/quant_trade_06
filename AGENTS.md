Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Core Development Rules

1. Package Management
   - ONLY use uv
   - Installation: `uv add package`
   - Running tools: `uv run tool`
   - Upgrading: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`
   - FORBIDDEN: `uv pip install`, `@latest` syntax

2. Code Quality
   - Type hints required for all code
   - Public APIs must have docstrings
   - Functions must be focused and small
   - Follow existing patterns exactly
   - Line length: 88 chars maximum

3. Testing Requirements
   - Framework: `uv run pytest`
   - Async testing: use anyio, not asyncio
   - Coverage: test edge cases and errors
   - New features require tests
   - Bug fixes require regression tests

4. Code Style
    - PEP 8 naming (snake_case for functions/variables)
    - Class names in PascalCase
    - Constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    - Document with docstrings
    - Use f-strings for formatting


## Python Tools

## Code Formatting
1. Ruff
   - Format: `uv run ruff format .`
   - Check: `uv run ruff check .`
   - Fix: `uv run ruff check . --fix`
   - Critical issues:
     - Line length (88 chars)
     - Import sorting (I001)
     - Unused imports
   - Line wrapping:
     - Strings: use parentheses
     - Function calls: multi-line with proper indent
     - Imports: split into multiple lines

2. Type Checking
   - Tool: `uv run pyright`
   - Requirements:
     - Explicit None checks for Optional
     - Type narrowing for strings
     - Version warnings can be ignored if checks pass

3. Pre-commit
   - Config: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   - Runs: on git commit
   - Tools: Prettier (YAML/JSON), Ruff (Python)
   - Ruff updates:
     - Check PyPI versions
     - Update config rev
     - Commit config first
